# Meeting 14-03
## Convension
- Use ready/valid interfaces

- Branch prediction antager altid at branchen tages
- validbit/Readybit
  - Validbit in RS is 1 if instruction is valid
  - Ff Readybit 1 is 1 then d1 is data, if readybit 1 is 0 then d1 is a tag  
- Datatypes:
  - RS entry [valid bit|data tag| ready bit0|tag0/d0|ready bit1|tag1/d1|func3|Took-Branch-bit]
  - To FU from RS [desttag|d0|d1]
  - From FU [desttag|d0|d1]
  - Kill bus (from branch unit) [data/tag]

- forwarding

## Immidiate design considerations 
- 2-stage decoder:
  - if synchronous memory is used for both ROB and RF then we risc a value being needed by RF and send by ROB to pipeline in the same clock 

## Blocks to design
- Control and memory block consisting of rob,RF and DECODER AND RENAMER: KARL AND TJARK
- 
- 
## Todo:
 - add registerfile to diagram


## Timeline:
- 1 week understand design
- 2 weeks Fledge out design
- 2 weeks test 
- 3 weeks kaos

## For next week 
- Define Need to have
- Define Nice to have
