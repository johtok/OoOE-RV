# OoOE-RV
This is an Out-of-order execution implementation of a 5-stage RISC-V processor! *pretty sweet*

# What's a OoOE
Hmmm i dunno but many do!
- The book Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach has some mentions of it in chapter 3.
- Some dudes mostly from the university of Japan have made [RSD](https://github.com/rsd-devel/rsd) which is "very fast due to aggressive OoO features" ðŸ˜¤ with the paper: [An Open Source FPGA-Optimized Out-of-Order RISC-V Soft Processor](https://www.rsg.ci.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/members/shioya/pdfs/Mashimo-FPT'19.pdf)
- Some other dude from USC Berkley have made Berkleys out of order machine or [BOOM](https://boom-core.org/) of which their latest paper is [SonicBOOM](https://carrv.github.io/2020/papers/CARRV2020_paper_15_Zhao.pdf)
- Roger espasa from semidynamics technology services has presented a talk upon their implementation of a [Out of order RISC-V Vector Unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzID6kk8RNs)
